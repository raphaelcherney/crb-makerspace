# CRB Makerspace Policies

<img src="../assets/follow-the-rules.gif" alt="Follow the Rules" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

All users of the CRB Makerspace (Room A277) must review these rules, formally agree to them, and follow them at all times in the space.

!!! warning "Important"

    **Safety is the number one priority when using the Makerspace.** Do not use equipment you are not authorized to use. If you need a refresher on anything, just ask. If something feels unsafe or you see someone else acting unsafely, say something immediately.

!!! failure "Failure to Follow Policies"

    Violation of these rules may result in loss of Makerspace privileges and/or access.

## General
- Always follow these policies, posted notices, and staff instructions.
- **Do not use tools in the Makerspace alone.** There must be someone in the lab who can see you AND has access to the makerspace.
- Use the right tool for the job. If you are unsure of **anything** or need refreshing on procedure, just ask! Raphael is the most expensive and useful tool in the shop. **Ask questions often.**
- Report broken or malfunctioning equipment immediately. **Do not attempt repairs yourself.**
- **Leave the Makerspace cleaner and better than when you entered.** Put away tools when done, clean up all chips/debris, and spend an additional 10% of your time contributing to improving the state of the shared space. No one should know what type of tools and materials you used because your workspace should be clean.
- **Do not remove tools from the space without explicit approval and a documented equipment checkout.** It is generally best to bring your project to the space rather than take tools away. If you do need tools, just ask, as some tools are available for checkout.
- No food or drink in the Makerspace.
