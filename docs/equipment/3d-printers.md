## Hazard level

<span style="background-color: green; color: white; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 2.2em; font-weight: bold;">LOW</span>

!!! warning

    - Hot surfaces: nozzle (180-260°C) and heated bed (50-110°C) cause severe burns
    - Moving parts can pinch or crush
    - Risk of inhalation of ultrafine particles and VOCs during printing

## Safety

- **Do not touch hotend.** Print beds and nozzles can exceed 200°C. Always assume hot surfaces until printer indicates it has cooled.
- Keep hands, hair, and clothing away from moving parts. Tie back long hair and secure loose sleeves or jewelry.
- **Use only approved materials.** PLA is the default; other filaments must be approved by staff due to fumes and print settings.
- Ensure that the first layer prints correctly before leaving.
- **Do not use metal tools on print surfaces.** They can damage the finish and affect adhesion. Use the provided plastic tools to remove parts and adhesives as directed.
- If something seems wrong (unusual noises, smoke/odors, spaghetti print), pause the job and notify staff immediately.
- Know how to pause/stop. Familiarize yourself with the emergency stop/pause on the specific printer before starting.
- Remove parts, replace print bed, and tidy up when finished.

## Materials

Parts in the CRB Makerspace are generally printed with PLA, or polylactic acid, which is a versatile, biodegradable plastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. Other materials are available upon request.

**Do not attempt to change or reload filaments yourself.** Ask for assistance if a change or replacement is needed.

## Guide

- **The clipboard must be filled out for every print job.**
- Ask for assistance for changing filament.
- Long or large prints (3+ hours) must be coordinated with Raphael.
- Remove parts and clean the build surface when your print is done; leave the printer ready for the next user.
- The 3D printers must be started in person. They are not connected to the nextwork (on purpose). Set up the print with the printers software, add the file to a microSD card or USB drive, and start the print on the device. ##Ensure the correct material is selected for use.
- Watch the first layer complete before leaving. Most failures occuer on the first layer.
- Promptly remove prints when complete. **Do not use metal tools to remove parts from the print bed.** Use plastic tools instead to prevent damage to the print surfaces.
- Clean up all pieces and return the print bed in the printer before leaving.
