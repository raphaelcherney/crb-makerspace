- Always use eye protection.
- Lower blade guide to adjust above the intended workpiece.
- Insert the key and turn on the machine.
- Feed steadily.  **No fingers in line with blade.** Use push sticks for small parts.
- No backing out while running. Stop the machine first or you risk pulling out a moving blade.
- Turn off the machine and return the key.
- Clean up your workspace.

## Teeth per inch

Fewer teeth per inch (TPI) provides a faster feed rate and a rougher finish. More teeth per inch provide a smooth finish but slower cut. **At least three teeth should be in the material when cutting.**

### Minimum material thickness

| Teeth per inch | Minimum material thickness |
| --- | --- |
| 6 TPI | 1/2" thick |
| 10 TPI | 5/16" thick |
| 14 TPI | 1/4" thick |
| 18 TPI | 5/32" thick |
| 24 TPI | 1/8" thick |

## Blade width

When making straight cuts, use the widest blade available. For contour or scroll work, select a blade that fits the minimum radius requirement:

### Minimum cutting radius

| Blade thickness | Minimum cutting radius |
| --- | --- |
| 1/8" blade | 3/16" radius |
| 1/4" blade | 5/8" radius |
| 3/8" blade | 1-1/2" radius |
| 1/2" blade | 2-1/2" radius |
