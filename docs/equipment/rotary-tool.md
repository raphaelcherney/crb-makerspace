!!! warning

    - High-speed rotating bits (5,000-35,000 RPM) can cause severe cuts
    - Flying debris and broken bits become projectiles
    - Bit can grab workpiece causing loss of control
    - Generates fine dust particles
    - Hot debris and workpieces after use can burn skin

## Safety
- Always secure your workpiece (vise, clamp, or fixture).
- Always wear ANSI Z87.1 safety glasses; use a dust mask/respirator for sanding/cutting that generates dust.
- Hearing protection recommended for extended use.
- Tie back long hair and remove/secure loose clothing and jewelry.

## Use
- Select the correct bit/accessory for the material.
- Unplug (or remove battery) before changing bits.
- Ensure the collet is properly sized and tightened; remove the wrench before powering on.
- Let the tool reach full speed before contacting the work; do not stall the motor—let the tool do the work.
- Keep your hands and body out of the rotationbehind the bit and direct sparks/debris away from yourself and others.
- Do not apply pressure to the sides ("side‑load") cut‑off wheels; use guards where provided.

## Materials & Fumes
- Avoid materials that produce hazardous fumes (e.g., PVC/vinyl). Use fume extraction when cutting plastics.
- Ask staff if you’re unsure about a material.

## Cleanup
- Power off and allow hot accessories to cool before handling.
- Return the tool, bits, and accessories to their proper locations.
