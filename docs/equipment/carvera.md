Onshape Miro doesn't have right feeds and speeds. **Verify the speeds**

Check your stock height and make sure there is MDF underneath

Double check your settings with the [feeds and speeds table](https://wiki.makera.com/en/speeds-and-feeds) for your bit. Make sure you are using the right tool for your material. Make sure the cutting speed is correct. Make sure the tool is in the right tool position for your CAM program.

Tip: Add one inch to tool length to air cut first.
